        "The subtask requires performing a permutation test to assess the association between 'Academic Year' and 'Knowledge_Classification'. This involves creating an observed contingency table, calculating the observed Chi-square statistic, running a permutation loop to generate permuted Chi-square statistics, and then calculating and displaying the permutation p-value, followed by a significance comparison. I will consolidate these steps into a single code block to ensure efficient execution and a clear, sequential flow of the permutation test."
