### **Core Concepts & Strategy**

#### **What is Dignified Menstruation?**
Dignified Menstruation (DM) is a **transformative, human rights-based, and holistic approach** to menstruation. It moves beyond the limited scope of "menstrual hygiene management" to address the root causes of menstrual discrimination, such as taboos, stigma, and violence. DM is defined as the **freedom from all forms of menstrual discrimination**, including shame, abuse, silence, and the deprivation of resources throughout a menstruator's life. It encompasses the **dignity, rights, and well-being** of all menstruators, with a focus on including often-excluded groups like individuals with disabilities and LGBTQIA+ people.

#### **The "4 D" Strategy**
The GSCDM's strategy is built on four pillars:
- **DIALOGUE**: Deconstructing patriarchy and power dynamics through education, research, policy advocacy, and networking.
- **DISMANTLE**: Breaking down the oppressive systems—institutional, structural, and social—that negatively affect menstruation.
- **DEVELOP**: Empowering individuals to access their fundamental human rights and resources, enabling them to live dignified lives.
- **DISCOURSE**: Igniting a global conversation to unite organizations and individuals in leading dignity-centered menstrual movements.

#### **Core Values**
The campaign's work is guided by the following values:
- Human Rights
- Non-Discrimination
- Life Cycle Approach
- Survivor-Centered Approach
- Global Advocacy
- Social Inclusion
- Reproductive Justice
- Accountability
